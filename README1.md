## Description
This website allows users to brows through my growing portfolio of coding projects. The project portfolio is a second attempt at my original portfolio website, with a new layout, code updates, bug fixes and additional material.

In order to scroll to work, just click on the item you are looking for on the top right hand corner of the screen. For example, if you would like to review my work portfolio, click work in the right hand corner and it will automatically take you to the work section of my page. 

To view my work, click on the image tags which will take you directly to relevant project pages. These pages house a project summary and information on the project, the links to the github repository and website link. This will continue to be updated as more projects are created. -->

# About the Author 

My name is Eileen Mitchell. I am from Visalia, CA and graduated with a BS in City and Regional Planning, Minor in Political Science and Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) from Fresno State University.

I recently began a new coding bootcamp through the University of Washington in Fullstack Development and now reside in Bothell, WA working as a permit technician for a civil engineering firm. I love what I do, but have been intrigued by the world of tech. One similarity I have found between both of these jobs is the need to look for solutions, wherever they might be. I find this exciting, and am continuing to expand my knowledge through various projects.
